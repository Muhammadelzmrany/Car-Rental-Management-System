---

## ✅ Requirements Verification

### 1. Car Management
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE**

**Implementation:**
- **Registration:** `admin/addcars.php` - Full car registration with:
  - Name, model, year, plate_id (unique), status, price_per_day

---

### 3. Reservation System
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE**

**Implementation:**
- **Reservation Creation:** `php/rent.php` - Full reservation flow with:
  - Car availability check (isavailable = 1)
  - Flexible duration support (hours, days, weeks, months, years)
  - **Double booking prevention** ✅:
    - SQL query checks for date overlaps with existing reservations
    - Prevents same car from being reserved for overlapping dates
    - Checks car status for 'pending', 'confirmed', 'picked_up' states
    - Uses date range comparison: `pickup_date <= ? AND return_date >= ?`
    - Locks car record during transaction (`FOR UPDATE`)
  
  - Lifecycle management:
    - Initial status: `pending`
    - Updates: `confirmed` (after payment), `picked_up` (admin), `returned` (admin)
  - Total cost calculation based on daily rate × duration
  - Transaction support for data consistency

- **Pickup/Return Management:** `admin/pickup_return.php` - Admin actions:
  - Mark reservation as `picked_up` → updates car status to 'rented'
  - Mark reservation as `returned` → updates car status to 'available'
  - Car availability toggle (isavailable flag)

- **Multiple Branches Support:**
  - Branch assignment during car registration
  - Branch visibility in searches and reservations
  - Branch info linked through `cars.branch_id` FK

**Database:** `reservations` table
- Primary Keys: `id`
- Foreign Keys:
  - `customer_id` → `users` (CASCADE)
  - `car_id` → `cars` (RESTRICT)
  - `branch_id` → `branches` (RESTRICT)
- Columns:
  - pickup_date, return_date (date fields)
  - pickup_time, return_time (datetime fields for future flexibility)
  - total_cost (DECIMAL 10,2)
  - reservation_status ENUM (pending, confirmed, picked_up, returned, cancelled)
- Constraint: `return_date >= pickup_date` (CHECK constraint)
- Sample data: 2 test reservations with different statuses

---

- **Transaction Security:**
  - CSRF token validation
  - Prepared statements
  - Input sanitization
  - Period validation (rental must be completed before return payment)

- **Status Management:**

## 🎯 Feature Implementation Details

### Double Booking Prevention (CRITICAL)
**Implementation Verified:** `php/rent.php` (Lines 270-290)

```php
// Checks for date overlaps with existing active reservations
$overlap_check = $conn->prepare("
    SELECT COUNT(*) as overlap_count 
    FROM reservations 
    WHERE car_id = ? 
      AND reservation_status IN ('pending', 'confirmed', 'picked_up')
      AND (
        (pickup_date <= ? AND return_date >= ?) OR
        (pickup_date <= ? AND return_date >= ?) OR
        (pickup_date >= ? AND return_date <= ?)
      )
");
```

**Logic:**
- Prevents same car from being reserved for overlapping dates
- Checks three overlap scenarios: start overlap, end overlap, complete inside
- Only counts active reservations (not cancelled/returned)
- Uses database-level locking (FOR UPDATE)

### Multiple Offices Support
**Implementation Verified:** Throughout codebase

- Cars assigned to branches via `branch_id`
- Search filters by branch
- Reports display branch information
- Reservation-branch relationship maintained
- 5 sample branches with different locations

### Reservation Lifecycle
**States:** pending → confirmed → picked_up → returned

**Transitions:**
1. **pending:** Initial state after reservation creation
2. **confirmed:** After successful payment
3. **picked_up:** When admin marks car as picked up
4. **returned:** When admin marks car as returned
5. **cancelled:** Manual cancellation (optional)

### Payment Integration
**Flow:**
1. Customer reserves car (status: pending)
2. Payment page displays with reservation ID
3. Customer enters payment details
4. Payment transaction created in database
5. Reservation status updated to confirmed
6. Car marked as rented

---

## 🐛 Bug Fixes Applied

### Fix #1: Column Name Error ✅
**Issue:** `price` column not found in cars table
**Root Cause:** Database uses `price_per_day` but some code referenced `price`
**Fix Applied:** 
- Updated `admin/updatecar.php` Line 27: UPDATE statement
- Updated `admin/updatecar.php` Line 46: SELECT with alias `AS price`
- Status: RESOLVED
